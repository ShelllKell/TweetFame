Shelby's UX and docs use notes.

#BowTie Notes

###Docs
- Example of Promdate.io link is broken in Example Applications, but I found it down on the right in the security section. Not an intuitive place to look for it.
- "Requests that are not processed by the frontend or â‹ˆ BowTie endpoints will be proxied to this URL with relevant authentication headers." - I'm unsure of how this all works, more explanation on how signing in/out on bowtie links with my app might be helpful (Dashboard GUI - Backend).
- Making sure to link a backend application, you still need to host and link it to another third party?
- Liked the step-by-step walk through of how to set it up with the gem, SSH key, etc.


###UX
- Had to have multiple page refreshes when creating my splash page before my committed changes showed on the display(right side).
- I tried signing up with a 6 character password. The flash was just a red outline of the password box, but no text explaining if it needed to be longer or if it needed a capital letter, etc.
- Isn't clear at the beginning that you can add widgets anywhere in the layout on the landing page. Thought once I deleted them I could only add them back in at the bottom. Found out that's not the case once I read documentation thoroughly/saw '+add' pop up once later on.
- As I scroll through documentation, it'd be cool if once I scrolled far enough down, the left navigation scrolled to keep the section I'm reading highlighted in view.
- I have two tweetfame projects in my dropdown menu that are the same project. Should only be one.


###Additional Notes
- Getting Started guide returns me an error - connection timed out.
- It'd be awesome to do video guides on quick setup (if there is even such a thing).
- User/subscription tracking is excellent! I love how much info you can get about your users. Also the csv exporting is a great feature.
