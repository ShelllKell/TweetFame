Shelby's UX and docs use notes.

#BowTie Notes

###Docs
- Making sure to link a backend application, you still need to host and link it to another third party (example of Promdate.io or something similar would be cool to see live, not just GitHub).
- "Requests that are not processed by the frontend or â‹ˆ BowTie endpoints will be proxied to this URL with relevant authentication headers." - I'm unsure of how to get these authentication headers? (Dashboard GUI- Backend)
- Where would I put the logic: once they register, confirm email and are redirected back to my site, how could i hide a button on the splash page?

###UX
- Had to have multiple page refreshes when creating my splash page before my committed changes showed on the display(right side)
- I tried signing up with a 6 character password. The flash was just a red outline of the password box, but no text explaining if it needed to be longer or if it needed a capital letter, etc.
- Isn't clear at the beginning that you can add widgets anywhere in the layout on the landing page. Thought once I deleted them I could only add them back in at the bottom. Found out that's not the case once I read documentation thoroughly/saw '+add' pop up once later on.
- As I scroll through documentation, it'd be cool if once I scrolled far enough down, the left navigation scrolled to keep the section I'm reading highlighted in view.


###Additional Notes
- Getting Started guide returns me an error - connection timed out.
- Video guides on quick setup(if there is even such a thing) would be awesome.
