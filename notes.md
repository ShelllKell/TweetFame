#BowTie Notes

##Login
- I tried signing up with a 6 character password. The flash was just a red outline of the password box, but no text explaining if it needed to be longer or if it needed a capital letter, etc.


###Loves
- Thorough documentation

###Betters
- Had to have multiple page refreshes when creating my splash page before my committed changes showed on the display(right side)

###Additional Notes
- Getting Started guide returns me an error - connection timed out.
- Video guides on quick setup(if there is even such a thing) would be awesome.

###Typos:

##### Dashboard GUI - Screenshots located in app/assets/images:
- Post Registration
- Landing Page

##### More
- In adding a backend URL - /assets/images/backend_typo.png
